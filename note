 BUG ISSUES: 
 After I am logged in, say on the Profile page or the Search page. 
 IF I hit refresh the page refreshes with the same 'slug' but the page is empty and I have to 're-login' to see them.

 HOME PAGE needs the NAvigation Layer.

TODOS: 
An Example POst

First Step seems straightforward...but then I have to add the image and my current posts just updated right? 
2nd The 'post create card' is still showing and I have to push the 'step two button'. 
3rd Then 'step 3' shows up before I am ready. 4th I choose an image ...there is a missing image and I get no confirmation. 
Then it just froze up. ? Then once it is created. The image not there ,... step one form is still visible, and 'step two' button is still visible. 
postStepZero is STILL set to true. 
One more thing, when I go back to working locally, the production images will be blank I bet.

one image missing...other is there. 
the second image url did not get saved to the db. 


Remodeling and Renovations. Free estimates.
*(issues with categories not updating properly.)
*(issues with the flow for creating a post.)
# (need websites to display)


Plan: 

Start at the Dashboard Page. 
initial visit to the page and all state data for the steps are set correctly. false. 
hit 'create post' and postStepZero goes TRUE. 
hit 'create' and postStepOne goes true. 
step 2 choose a 'image' and postStepZero goes TRUE. ( * no image preview visible !)
hit 'step 3' button and ...step 2 still visible. 
hit 'accept' all posts steps go to 'FALSE' (*  but then postStepZero flips back to TRUE. !)

STOP: must figure out the postStepZero issue. 
# we have a confusing name mismatch for 1. const [readyToComplete, setAllowEdit] = useState(false);  in 'CreatePostDisplayCard' 

CHECK: that postImage var is correct ... CreatePostDisplayCard - props:
ACTION: 
 dispatch(postAction.acceptPost(currentPost._id)).catch((err) => console.error(err))

 postCreateCard...create post button should set zero to true.


 WHAT: when I set the status to activated when editing a post...it set the postStepTwo to TRUE ? 

 need a new action reducer for update_post_creation
ok. 
 hadn't implemented this yet...updateCreatingPost 

 first post works fine, 2nd will not open up 'create post' button.
